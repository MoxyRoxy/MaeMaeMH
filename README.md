# Moxy

I write code. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it documents the mistake.

## What’s in here
- CS studies, compressed into repositories  
- Scripts, tools, and projects that started as “quick ideas”  
- Experiments that either became useful or quietly educated me  

## Manage expectations
- Not everything is finished  
- Not everything is clean  
- Some things work suspiciously well  

## Tech, roughly
- A lot of Python  
- Automation, analysis, general tinkering  
- If something is annoying, it gets automated  

## Non-technical essentials
- Tea is part of the workflow  
- Plushys supervise code quality  
- Neither has caused a bug so far  

## Philosophy
Simple code > clever code  
Complexity is not an achievement  
Comments are allowed  

If you find something useful: good.  
If not: also good.
